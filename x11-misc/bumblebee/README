This is ebuild for installing bumblebee on your gentoo machine.
It was written for version 1.6.40.

PLEASE READ INSTALL FILES VERY CAREFULLY BEFORE APPLYING CHANGES TO YOUR MACHINE.

It might, and in fact as practise is showing contains errors.

It will now be in testing stage for x64 and x86.

Unchanged:
- Still use unpacked VirtualGL files from a deb package
- Still, probably, need some manual work with files.
- Still doesn't use start and stop mechanisms with acpi_call.

what is new:
- It will try to recognise your laptop while installing.
  If it doesn't know your laptop, it will ask what type of
  connection (CRT-0, DFP-0) you are using.

- Doesn't need to store backups.

- Added simple script to get rid of previous installation. (uninstall_bumblebee.sh)
  Use verry carefully !!!
  Just removes all files that were installed by previous version install

- Have a dependency, acpi_call ebuild, it is now in main tree
  so there should be no problems.

- X nvidia instance now uses own libglx.so, so if I understand
  everything correctly then the second X instance has hw acceleration
  too.

- x86 support.

Problems:
- some documentation files are automatically packaged while installing.
  Don't know how to fix that yet :(


plans for future:
- A cup of tea (or coffee)
- Arrange usage of VirtualGL ebuild from https://github.com/speckins/usr-local-portage
- Rearrange of git repo to make an overlay.
- Testing.
- Moving bumblebee install into rainyday overlay.

INSTALLATION:
"sudo layman -S"
"sudo layman -add rainyday"
"sudo emerge -avt bumblebee" 

Good luck.
